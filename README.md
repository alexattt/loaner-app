This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

Simple app for loan receiving, which utilizes local storage for data saving. </br>
Decided to use primeng library for this project, since I have never used it. 
Found it very easy and useful, rich with components etc.!

I used visual studio code as an IDE to develop this app. To run app locally, clone it. </br>
Then run npm install in the root of the project. Then run ng serve.
